# Classification
The dataset are divided into 2 portions (80% for training &amp; 20% for testing). I'm using the training dataset to build the classification model. The model that I choose is decision tree by using ID3 algorithm. The final outcome of the program execution is the classification result for all instances un the testing dataset.
